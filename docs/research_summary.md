# Big-Brain Research Ledger (v0.1)

This living note tracks high-leverage literature & ideas feeding into our WNBA edge engine.
Feel free to skim – each bullet finishes with an *action tag* that links research to an upcoming code/data task.

## 1. Calibration > Accuracy for Profitability
- **Walsh & Joshi 2023** show NBA betting ROI ↑ 70 % when models are optimised for probability calibration rather than raw accuracy.  *Action BB-L1*: integrate temperature/Dirichlet scaling head on Agent-1's HGT output and expose Brier/Beta calibration scores in `train.py`.

## 2. Kelly-Aware & Sharpe-Aware Portfolio Formulations
- **Vélez et al 2023** merge NN forecasts with Sharpe & Kelly constrained optimisation; reach 135 % profit. Provide matrices for multi-event Kelly. *Action BB-L2*: port their convex Kelly‐matrix solver into `python/model/losses.py` as differentiable dual-objective.
- **Srivastava et al 2025** introduce modular, risk-aware RL reward (return, downturn, Treynor). Could replace plain Kelly when we move to reinforcement learning sizing. *Action BB-L3*: design reward stub in `python/losses.py` guarded by flag `--risk_rl`.

## 3. Graph-Centric Performance Models
### 3.1 Soccer → transferable ideas
- **Ochin et al 2025** combine EdgeConv + X3D backbone for broadcast video; gain +7 mAP.  Shows value of local game-state encoding.
- **TacticAI 2024 (Wang et al)**: geometric deep-learning on spatio-temporal tracking; predictor + counter-factual repositioning.

### 3.2 Basketball / WNBA
- **TacticExpert 2025**: graph-transformer with symmetry-aware priors; mixture-of-experts helps learn offensive scenario specialists.
- **nbaGNNs repo (Wilaj 2025)**: node2vec + GCN for point-differential link prediction – good baseline code for schedule graphs.

*Action BB-D1*: Pre-train Agent-1 HGT on open NBA + NCAA Women play-by-play before fine-tuning; add Vegas line & line-move edges.

## 4. Market-Facing Insights
- **Hubáček 2019** & **Gale­kwa 2024 Review** catalogue market inefficiencies and feature engineering tricks (e.g. bookmaker margin, crowd over-reaction).  *Action BB-M1*: nightly cron to compute margin & hysteresis features from Odds API.

## 5. Research Gaps Identified
1. No public SOTA on **WNBA** specifically – we will assemble multi-league pre-training dataset and test domain adaptation.
2. Very little on **reward-calibrated GNNs** for betting stakes – our dual-objective loss will pioneer this.
3. **Real-time limits / liquidity risk** rarely modelled – optional extension: overlay stake-scaling by soft Liu liquidity curve.

## 6. Immediate To-Dos (next 48h)
| Task | Folder | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- |
